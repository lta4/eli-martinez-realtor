                    <p>"Elizabeth made our dreams come true. After our initial contact, we followed the plan laid out-including fixing up our credit, fixing up the house with Elizabeth's incredible staging team, Compass's unique Bridge program, Elizabeth's incredible faith and enthusiasm and looking at a 1000 houses, we found a house waiting on us. Two weeks after we moved in, the pandemic shut us into our gorgeous home. What a way to be shut in! We love Elizabeth's packodo much that we recommended Compass to my in-law. Thanks! We will forever appreciative of the good work of Elizabeth and Compass."</p>

                    <p>"Elizabeth Martinez was great she went above and beyond so that we would get the most profit out of our sale as possible. She even offered us a program that Compass would loans us Money interest free to make home improvements so we can sell for maximum probability. She walked us through entire process and did not give an inch on the negotiation of the final sale price. I would highly recommend her to anyone I know and I will use her on any of my sales or purchase in the future. I also didn't mention the 13k sellers credit she got for us on the home she helped us buy."</p>
